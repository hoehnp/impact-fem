<h2>Impact Repository</h2>

<p>Impact source codes are kept in <a href="http://sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" title="Click here to view Sourceforge">Sourceforge</a> CVS (Concurrent Versions System) repository.</p>

<p>CVS (Concurrent Versions System) is a tool used by many software developers to manage
changes within their source code tree. CVS provides the means to store not only 
the current version of a piece of source code, but a record of all changes 
(and who made those changes) that have occurred to that source code. 
Use of CVS is particularly common on projects with multiple developers, 
since CVS ensures changes made by one developer are not accidentally removed when 
another developer posts their changes to the source tree.</p>

<p>Though CVS repositories are most commonly accessed using a special piece of software 
called a CVS client, Sourceforge also provide a web-based interface to view CVS repositories.
<a href="http://impact.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/impact/Impact/Impact/" target="_blank" 
title="Click here to browse the source codes in Sourceforge">
Browsing the CVS tree</a> 
gives you a great view into the current status of this project's code. 
You may also view the complete history of any file in the repository.</p>

<h2>Using CVS Client</h2>
<p>The most convenient way to access Impact CVS repository and to follow 
any updates by the developers and to commit changes (if you are the developer and
have write access to the repository)
is by using CVS client.</p>

<p>There are many free CVS clients available. 
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/" target="_blank" 
title="Click to download Eclipse">Eclipse</a> 
is one of them that supports Windows, Linux and Mac operating systems. 
In Windows OS, you need to download first then install it to your computer.
For Ubuntu users, just select Eclipse from Ubuntu Software Center and click Install.</p>
