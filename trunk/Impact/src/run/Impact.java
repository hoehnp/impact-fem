/**
 * This is the main program. The only thing that happens here is that an
 * instance of the program is started. This happens in the main() method Notes
 * on how to make this work under Linux..... (after much frustration) 1. Export
 * the classes as a directory, selecting all referenced classes and resources in
 * the dialog panel. 2. Go to the directory (example, you exported to
 * /home/myuser/test), then cd /home/myuser/test 3. If you have exported class
 * files, then write java run.Impact (note the dot) and the program should run.
 * 4. If you have exported java files, then make sure there are no class files
 * in the directory by writing rm run/.class 5. Compile the program by writing
 * javac run/ 6. go to 3.
