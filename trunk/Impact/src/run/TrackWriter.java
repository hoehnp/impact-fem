/**
 * This object is the TrackWriter. There can be several different trackwriters
 * derived from this class, but they all have one thing in common. The
 * purpouse is to write output files from the simulation in a format decided
 * by the Tracker class. The layout here is very similar to the Writer class
 * which creates output from the elements. A subclass called GidTrackWriter is
 * supplied as default. This writes the output so that it is readable from the
 * GID pre- and postprocessor. Creation date: (2002-09-20 23.59.42)
