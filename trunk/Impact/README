Installation
------------
Impact requires Java and Java3D to be installed on your computer. 
Download: 
1) Java SE Runtime Environment (JRE) or Java SE Development Kit(JDK)
http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp

2) Java3D
https://java3d.dev.java.net/binary-builds.html

All this is explained in the web documentation which is found online at http://impact.sf.net

It is simplest to run Impact from the GUI. To do that, just run the ImpactGUI.bat file in this directory if you are a Windows user
or make the ImpactGUI.sh runnable (chmod 777 ImpactGUI.sh) and run that with ./ImpactGUI if you are a Linux/Unix/Mac user.
Alternatively, just write  bash ImpactGUI.sh  to start.

You can also run the Impact solver alone from the console, stay in this directory. 
Impact is now started by writing   

bash Impact.sh examples/indatafile.in

where indatafile is one of the examples in the examples directory.
The resultfiles will end up there as well.

Impact can also use the GID pre-and postprocessor as environment.
The GID preprocessor can be configured to export Impact indata fies. 

Just copy the entire Impact.gid directory with files and all to the GID subdirectory. Example:
cd Impact/interfaces 
cp -r Impact /homes/myuser/GID7_0/problemtypes/

Instructions how to use this is documented in the manual.

Impact also interfaces with Nastran and Gmsh. More info in the manual.
