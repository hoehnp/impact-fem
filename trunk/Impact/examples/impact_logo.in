# This is an example of an indata file for the Impact Finite Element Program
# 
# It is a simple mix of rod and solid elements which are connected to each other
# The model is fixed in the upper left corner and is pulled by a constant
# force in the lower right corner.
#
# Sometimes this combination can be tricky and need a firm hand on the timestep
# control. In this case, it has been set to a fixed value. Autostep does not
# suffice.
#
# Please note that you can view the results with GID while the program is
# running so there is no need to wait for the completion of this simulation.
