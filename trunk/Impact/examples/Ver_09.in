#
# Problem Description
#
# A spring is fixed in one end and is connected to a mass at the other end.
# The mass has an inital velocity resulting in an oscillation.
# No damping is applied in this problem.
#
# Reference Results
#
# The analytical result for the deflection of the mass is as follows:
#
# x(t) = V(0) * sin(omega*t) / omega 
# omega = sqrt( k / m)
# where k is the spring stiffness and m is the end mass
#
# Impact results correspond well with theory.
#
# Engineering data
#
# Length 		L   =         1 m
# Stiffness  	k   =         1 N / m
# End mass		m   =         1 kg
# Velocity      Vi  =         1 m / s
